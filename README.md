Context


In the 21st century, cars are an important mode of transportation that provides us the opportunity for personal control and autonomy. In day-to-day life, people use cars for commuting to work, shopping, visiting family and friends, etc. Research shows that more than 76% of people prevent themselves from traveling somewhere if they don't have a car. Most people tend to buy different types of cars based on their day-to-day necessities and preferences. So, it is essential for automobile companies to analyze the preference of their customers before launching a car model into the market. Austo, a UK-based automobile company aspires to grow its business into the US market after successfully establishing its footprints in the European market.

In order to be familiar with the types of cars preferred by the customers and factors influencing the car purchase behavior in the US market, Austo has contracted a consulting firm.
